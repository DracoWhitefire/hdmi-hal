# Contributing to hdmi-hal

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This document covers the basics.

## Getting started

See [`doc/setup.md`](doc/setup.md) for build and check instructions.

## Issues and pull requests

**Open an issue first** if you're unsure whether something is a bug or if you want to
discuss a change before implementing it. For small, self-contained fixes a PR on its own
is fine.

- Bug reports: describe the trait method or associated type in question and what contract
  it fails to express correctly.
- Feature requests: a brief description of what you need and why is enough to start a
  conversation.
- PRs: keep them focused. One logical change per PR makes review faster and keeps
  history readable.

## Coding standards

- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` before pushing.
- Public items need rustdoc comments (`cargo rustdoc -- -D missing_docs` must pass).
- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is enforced; no unsafe code.
- All traits and public types must be usable in bare `no_std` environments. No trait
  method may require allocation.
- All public structs and enums must be `#[non_exhaustive]`.

## Commit and PR expectations

- Write commit messages in the imperative mood ("Add support for …", not "Added …").
- Keep commits logically atomic. A PR that touches three unrelated things should be
  three commits (or three PRs).
- CI must be green before a PR can merge: fmt, clippy, and docs.

## Trait stability

Trait changes are breaking changes for every implementor. The bar for modifying a trait
surface after initial publication is high. New methods require a default implementation
or a semver-breaking release. Additions and modifications must be reviewed against all
known consumers in the stack.

## Publishing and downstream dependencies

hdmi-hal is consumed by `scdc`, `frl-training`, and platform backend crates as a
versioned dependency. Changes that add or modify public API must be merged, tagged, and
published to crates.io before downstream crates can adopt them. The workflow is:

1. Merge and tag a release in this repo (`vX.Y.Z`).
2. The publish CI workflow uploads the new version to crates.io.
3. Update the version constraint in the downstream crate's `Cargo.toml`.

## Review process

PRs are reviewed on a best-effort basis. Expect feedback within a few days; if you
haven't heard back in a week feel free to ping the thread. Reviews aim to be
constructive — if something needs to change, the reviewer will explain why. Approval
from the maintainer is required to merge.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant 3.0](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read
it before participating.
