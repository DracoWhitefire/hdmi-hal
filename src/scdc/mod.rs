/// Raw register access to the SCDC register map over DDC/I²C.
///
/// SCDC is a bidirectional channel used for FRL link training initiation, scrambling
/// control, and CED (Character Error Detection) reporting. Any code that needs to touch
/// the SCDC register map does so through this trait.
///
/// The trait operates at the raw register level: a one-byte address and a one-byte
/// value. Typed register wrappers, named constants, and multi-register sequences belong
/// in the `culvert` crate, not here.
///
/// Every method is required. A transport that can read several registers in one DDC/I²C
/// transaction implements [`read_block`](Self::read_block) with that transaction; one
/// that cannot implements it with [`read_block_bytewise`], so the choice is visible in its
/// code:
///
/// ```
/// use core::convert::Infallible;
/// use hdmi_hal::scdc::{ScdcTransport, read_block_bytewise};
///
/// struct SimulatedScdc {
///     registers: [u8; 256],
/// }
///
/// impl ScdcTransport for SimulatedScdc {
///     type Error = Infallible;
///
///     fn read(&self, reg: u8) -> Result<u8, Infallible> {
///         Ok(self.registers[reg as usize])
///     }
///
///     fn write(&mut self, reg: u8, value: u8) -> Result<(), Infallible> {
///         self.registers[reg as usize] = value;
///         Ok(())
///     }
///
///     /// One register at a time: not one transaction.
///     fn read_block(&self, reg: u8, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Infallible> {
///         read_block_bytewise(self, reg, buf)
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    /// Write a single byte to the given SCDC register address.
    fn write(&mut self, reg: u8, value: u8) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;

    /// Read consecutive SCDC registers, starting at `reg`, into `buf`.
    ///
    /// Related registers, such as the status flags or the character error counters, are
    /// read together so that a value the sink updates between two of them cannot be
    /// read half before and half after the update. The contract:
    ///
    /// - **What it reads.** `buf[i]` is register `reg + i`.
    /// - **One transaction.** The whole buffer is read in one DDC transaction (the
    ///   register offset written, a repeated START, `buf.len()` bytes read, STOP), or an
    ///   error is returned. An implementation never splits the read into several
    ///   transactions, and never falls back to one register at a time. Calls made at the
    ///   same time through shared references do not interleave on the bus.
    ///   [`read_block_bytewise`] is the one exception to both, and a transport that uses
    ///   it says so.
    /// - **No snapshot promised.** One transaction does not mean the sink returns a
    ///   consistent snapshot: whether it holds its registers still during a read is up to
    ///   the sink.
    /// - **Length limit.** An implementation may have a maximum length, if it documents
    ///   it; a longer buffer is an error, not split. A caller that needs a longer read
    ///   splits it itself, knowing the parts are separate transactions.
    /// - **Empty buffer.** `Ok`, with no bus activity.
    /// - **On error,** the contents of `buf` are unspecified.
    /// - **Past `0xFF`.** The caller does not read past register `0xFF`. If it does, the
    ///   result is unspecified: [`read_block_bytewise`] wraps to `0x00`, a real burst
    ///   read leaves it to the sink.

/// Implements [`ScdcTransport::read_block`] with one [`read`](ScdcTransport::read) per
/// byte, for a transport that cannot read several registers in one transaction.
///
/// This is the documented exception to `read_block`'s "one transaction" rule: each byte
/// is its own transaction, so a value the sink updates between two of them can be read
/// half before and half after the update, and another caller's transaction can land in
/// between. A transport that uses it should say so in its documentation.
///
/// Reads stop at the first error, which is returned. An empty buffer reads nothing. A
/// read past register `0xFF` wraps to `0x00`.
